London Listeni is the capital city of England and the United
Kingdom.[5] It is the most populous region, urban zone and
metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames,
London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history
going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.[6]
London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its
1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) mediaeval boundaries and in 2011 had a
resident population of 7,375, making it the smallest city in
England. Since at least the 19th century, the term London has also
referred to the metropolis developed around this core.[7] The bulk of
this conurbation forms the London region[8] and the Greater London
administrative area,[9][note 1] governed by the Mayor of London and
the London Assembly.[10]

London is a leading global city,[11][12] with strengths in the arts,
commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare,
media, professional services, research and development, tourism and
transport all contributing to its prominence.[13] It is one of the
world's leading financial centres[14][15][16] and has the fifth-or
sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world depending on
measurement.[note 2][17][18] London is a world cultural
capital.[19][20][21][22] It is the world's most-visited city as
measured by international arrivals[23] and has the world's largest
city airport system measured by passenger traffic.[24] London's 43
universities form the largest concentration of higher education in
Europe.[25] In 2012, London became the first city to host the modern
Summer Olympic Games three times.[26]

London has a diverse range of peoples and cultures, and more than 300
languages are spoken within its boundaries.[27] London had an official
population of 8,308,369 in 2012,[2] making it the most populous
municipality in the European Union,[28] and accounting for 12.5% of
the UK population.[29] The Greater London Urban Area is the
second-largest in the EU with a population of 9,787,426 according to
the 2011 census.[3] The London metropolitan area is the largest in the
EU with a total population of 13,614,409,[note 3][4][30] while the
Greater London Authority puts the population of London metropolitan
region at 21 million.[31] London had the largest population of any
city in the world from around 1831 to 1925.[32]

London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew
Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of
Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime
Meridian, 0° longitude, and GMT).[33] Other famous landmarks include
Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's
Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and The Shard. London is
home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and
other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National
Gallery, Tate Modern, British Library and 40 West End theatres.[34]
The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in
the world.[35][36]

Toponymy
Main article: Etymology of London


The name London may derive from the River Thames
The etymology of London is uncertain.[37] It is an ancient name, found
in sources from the 2nd century. It is recorded c. 121 as Londinium,
which points to Romano-British origin.[37] The earliest attempted
explanation, now disregarded, is attributed to Geoffrey of Monmouth in
Historia Regum Britanniae.[37] This had it that the name originated
from a supposed King Lud, who had allegedly taken over the city and
named it Kaerlud.[38]

From 1898, it was commonly accepted that the name was of Celtic origin
and meant place belonging to a man called *Londinos; this explanation
has since been rejected.[37] Richard Coates put forward an explanation
in 1998 that it is derived from the pre-Celtic Old European
*(p)lowonida, meaning 'river too wide to ford', and suggested that
this was a name given to the part of the River Thames which flows
through London; from this, the settlement gained the Celtic form of
its name, *Lowonidonjon;[39] this requires quite a serious amendment
however. The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form
Londinium with the modern Welsh Llundain, which should demand a form
*(h)lōndinion (as opposed to *londīnion), from earlier
*loundiniom. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the Welsh name
was borrowed back in from English at a later date, and thus cannot be
used as a basis from which to reconstruct the original name.

Until 1889, the name "London" officially only applied to the City of
London but since then it has also referred to the County of London and
now Greater London.[7]

Prehistory and antiquity
Two recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near
the Thames in the London area. In 1999, the remains of a Bronze Age
bridge were found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge.[40] This
bridge either crossed the Thames, or went to a (lost) island in the
river. Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500BC.[40] In 2010 the
foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4500BC, were found
on the Thames foreshore, south of Vauxhall Bridge.[41] The function of
the mesolithic structure is not known. Both structures are on South
Bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the
River Thames.[41]



In 1300, the City was still confined within the Roman walls.
Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the
area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans in 43
AD.[42] This lasted for just seventeen years and around 61, the Iceni
tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground.[43]
The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered and
superseded Colchester as the capital of the Roman province of
Britannia in 100. At its height during the 2nd century, Roman London
had a population of around 60,000.

Anglo-Saxon London


The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist
sally.
With the collapse of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London
ceased to be a capital and the walled city of Londinium was
effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation hung on in the St
Martin-in-the-Fields area until around 450.[44] From around 500, an
Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area,
slightly to the west of the old Roman city.[45] By about 680, it had
revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little
evidence of large-scale production of goods. From the 820s the town
declined because of repeated Viking attacks, and the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle recorded that it was "refounded" by Alfred the Great in
886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment of
Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman
walls. London then grew slowly until about 950, after which activity
increased dramatically.[46]

By the 11th century, London was beyond all comparison the largest town
in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in the Romanesque style by King
Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in
Europe. Winchester had previously been the capital of Anglo-Saxon
England, but from this time on, London became the main forum for
foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view
of Frank Stenton: "It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing
the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a
national capital."[47][48]

Middle Ages


Westminster Abbey, as seen in this painting (Canaletto, 1749), is a
World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important
buildings
Following his victory in the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of
Normandy, was crowned King of England in the newly finished
Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[49] William constructed the
Tower of London, the first of the many Norman castles in England to be
rebuilt in stone, in the southeastern corner of the city, to
intimidate the native inhabitants.[50] In 1097, William II began the
building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The
hall became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[51][52]

During the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which
had hitherto accompanied the royal English court as it moved around
the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly
fixed in one place. In most cases this was Westminster, although the
royal treasury, having been moved from Winchester, came to rest in the
Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true capital in
governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the City of London,
remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre, and
it flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of
London. In 1100, its population was around 18,000; by 1300 it had
grown to nearly 100,000.[53]

Disaster struck during the Black Death in the mid-14th century, when
London lost nearly a third of its population.[54] London was the focus
of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[55]

Early modern


The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.


London in 1806
During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to
Protestantism, with much of London passing from church to private
ownership.[56] The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed and
undressed from London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries where
it was considered indispensable.[57] But the tentacles of English
maritime enterprise hardly extended beyond the seas of north-west
Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean Sea
normally lay through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing
through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be
Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-opening of the Netherlands to English
shipping in January 1565 there at once ensued a strong outburst of
commercial activity.[58] The Royal Exchange was founded.[59]
Mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the East
India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New
World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants
arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an
estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[56]

In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived
in London at a time of hostility to the development of the theatre. By
the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very
compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster,
through the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605.[60] London was plagued
by disease in the early 17th century,[61] culminating in the Great
Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of
the population.[62]

The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city
and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[63] Rebuilding took
over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke[64][65][66] as
Surveyor of London.[67] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St
Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era new districts
such as Mayfair were formed in the west; and new bridges over the
Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port
of London expanded downstream.

In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over
the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was dogged by crime
and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional
police force.[68] In total, more than 200 offences were punishable by
death,[69] including petty theft.[70] Most children born in the city
died before reaching their third birthday.[71] The coffeehouse became
a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy and the
development of the printing press making news widely available; and
Fleet Street became the centre of the British press.

According to Samuel Johnson:

You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave
London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life;
for there is in London all that life can afford.

—Samuel Johnson, 1777[72]
Late modern and contemporary


British volunteer recruits in London, August 1914


A bombed-out London street during the Blitz of the Second World War
London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925.[73]
London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics,[74] claiming
14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[75] Rising traffic congestion
led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The
Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the
capital and some of the surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889
when the London County Council was created out of those areas of the
counties surrounding the capital. London was bombed by the Germans
during the First World War while during the Second World War the Blitz
and other bombing by the German Luftwaffe killed over 30,000 Londoners
and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across the
city. Immediately after the war, the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at
the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when London had barely
recovered from the war.

In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank. The Great
Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the "pea soup
fogs" for which London had been notorious. From the 1940s onwards,
London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from
Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and
Pakistan, making London one of the most diverse cities in Europe.

Primarily starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the
worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture
associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street. The role
of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's
political boundaries were expanded to take into account the growth of
the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During
The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing
attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by
the 1981 Brixton riot. Greater London's population declined steadily
in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of
8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal
ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the
London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration as the Canary
Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing role
as a major international financial centre during the 1980s.

The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London
against tidal surges from the North Sea. The Greater London Council
was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis
in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide
government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London
Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium
Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July
2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the
first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[76]

Local government
Main articles: Local government in London, History of local government
in London and List of heads of London government
The administration of London is formed of two tiers—a city-wide,
strategic tier and a local tier. City-wide administration is
coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local
administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[77] The GLA
consists of two elected components; the Mayor of London, who has
executive powers, and the London Assembly, who scrutinise the mayor's
decisions and can accept or reject his budget proposals each year. The
headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Southwark; the mayor is Boris
Johnson. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the
London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[78] The local
authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of
London Corporation.[79] They are responsible for most local services,
such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and
refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are
provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue
expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22
billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the
GLA).[80]

Policing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London,
is provided by the Metropolitan Police Force, overseen by the Mayor
through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[81][82] The
City of London has its own police force – the City of London
Police.[83] The British Transport Police are responsible for police
services on National Rail and London Underground services.[84]

The London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for
Greater London. It is run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority and is the third largest fire service in the world.[85]
National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London
Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest
free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[86]
The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS
where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames,[87][88] which is
under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington
Lock to the sea.[89]

National government
London is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many
government departments are based close to the Palace of Westminster,
particularly along Whitehall, including the Prime Minister's residence
at 10 Downing Street.[90] The British Parliament is often referred to
as the "Mother of Parliaments" (although this sobriquet was first
applied to England itself by John Bright)[91] because it has been the
model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created
many other parliaments. There are 73 Members of Parliament (MPs) from
London, who correspond to local parliamentary constituencies in the
national Parliament. Of these, 38 are from the Labour Party, 28 are
Conservatives, and 7 are Liberal Democrats.

seen from the air
Greater London is the top-level administrative subdivision covering
London. The small, ancient City of London at its core once contained
the whole settlement, but as the urban area grew the City Corporation
resisted attempts to amalgamate it with its suburbs, causing "London"
to be defined in a number ways for different purposes; and the
situation was once open to legal debate.[92][not in citation given]
Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town,
within which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[93][94]

The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in
size to Greater London, although some outer districts are omitted and
some places just outside are included. The area within the orbital M25
motorway is normally what is referred to as 'London'.[95] and the
Greater London boundary has been aligned to it in places.[96]

Outward urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green
Belt,[97] although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in
places, resulting in a separately defined Greater London Urban
Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[98] Greater London
is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London.[99] The
city is split by the River Thames into North and South, with an
informal central London area in its interior. The coordinates of the
nominal centre of London, traditionally considered to be the original
Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square
and Whitehall, are approximately 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W.[100]

Status
Within London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster
have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of
Greater London are the ceremonial counties.[101] The area of Greater
London has incorporated areas that were once part of the historic
counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[102]
London's status as the capital of England, and later the United
Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed officially—by statute or
in written form.[note 4]

Its position was formed through constitutional convention, making its
status as de facto capital a part of the UK's unwritten
constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from
Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th
centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and
thus the political capital of the nation.[106] More recently, Greater
London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is
known as London.[8]

Topography


Parliament Hill
Greater London encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres
(611 sq mi), an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a
population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760
/sq mi). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or
the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 8,382
square kilometres (3,236 sq mi) has a population of 13,709,000 and a
population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900
/sq mi).[107] Modern London stands on the Thames, its primary
geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from
the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain
surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill,
Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. The Thames was once a much
broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its
shores reached five times their present width.[108]

Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and
many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a
tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[109] The threat has
increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high
water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down
in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.[110]

In 1974, a decade of work began on the construction of the Thames
Barrier across the Thames at Woolwich to deal with this threat. While
the barrier is expected to function as designed until roughly 2070,
concepts for its future enlargement or redesign are already being
discussed.[111]

Climate


Regent Street in the snow
London has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb ), similar to much
of southern Britain. Despite its reputation as being a rainy city,
London receives less precipitation (with 601 mm (24 in) in a year),
than Rome (at 834 mm (33 in)), Bordeaux (at 923 mm (36 in)), Toulouse
(at 668 mm (26 in)), and Naples (at 1,006 mm (40 in) per
year).[112][113][114][115][116] Temperature extremes for all sites in
the London area range from 38.1 °C (100.6 °F) at Kew during August
2003, (which has been proposed to be the UK's highest 'accurate'
temperature)[117] down to −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) at Northolt during January
1962.[118] Temperatures of below −20 °C (−4.0 °F) have been noted
prior to the 20th century, but the accuracy cannot be validated.

Summers are generally warm and sometimes hot, the heat being boosted
by the urban heat island effect making the centre of London at times 5
°C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts. London's average July
high is 24 °C (75.2 °F). During the 2003 European heat wave there were
14 consecutive days above 30 °C (86.0 °F) and 2 consecutive days where
temperatures reached 38 °C (100.4 °F), leading to hundreds of heat
related deaths. Rain generally occurs on around 2 out of 10 summer
days. Spring and Autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant. On 1
October 2011, the air temperature attained 30 °C (86.0 °F) and in
April 2011 it reached 28 °C (82.4 °F). However in recent years both of
these months have also had snowfall. Temperature extremes range from
−10 °C (14.0 °F) to 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).

London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district
names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are
either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have
been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such
as parishes or former boroughs.

Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a
local area with its own distinctive character, but without official
boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London
boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[125][126] The City
of London is the main financial district,[127] and Canary Wharf has
recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the
Docklands to the east.

The West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district,
attracting tourists.[128] West London includes expensive residential
areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[129]
The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is £894,000
with similar average outlay in most of central London.[130]

The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known
for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the
poorest areas in London.[131] The surrounding East London area saw
much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites
throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames
Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was
developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and
Paralympics.[131]

and structures in London

London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any
particular architectural style, partly because of their varying
ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National
Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city,
particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white
stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London
pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman
remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in
the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor period Hampton Court
Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal
Thomas Wolsey c. 1515.[132] Wren's late 17th-century churches and the
financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the
Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old
Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate form part of the varied
architectural heritage.

The disused, but soon to be rejuvenated, 1939 Battersea Power Station
by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway
termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably
St. Pancras and Paddington.[133] The density of London varies, with
high employment density in the central area, high residential
densities in inner London and lower densities in Outer London.

The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding
area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated
nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends
of Park Lane respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert
Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a
nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal
points of the city centre. Older buildings are mainly brick built,
most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red
variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster
mouldings.[134]



Buckingham Palace is the official residence of the British monarch
In the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and
high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers such as 30 St Mary Axe,
Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square are mostly in the
two financial districts, the City of London and Canary
Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it
would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other
historic buildings. Nevertheless there are a number of very tall
skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London),
including the 72-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in
the European Union.

Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its
distinctive oval shape,[135] and the British Library in Somers
Town/Kings Cross. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames
to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called The
O2 Arena.

Parks and gardens

London and List of Local Nature Reserves in Greater London


Aerial view of Hyde Park
The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the Royal
Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens at the
western edge of central London, and Regent's Park on the northern
edge.[136] Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest
scientific zoo, and is near the tourist attraction of Madame Tussauds
Wax Museum.[137][138]

Closer to central London are the smaller Royal Parks of Green Park and
St. James's Park.[139] Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports
and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. A number of large parks lie
outside the city centre, including the remaining Royal Parks of
Greenwich Park to the south-east[140] and Bushy Park and Richmond Park
(the largest) to the south-west,[141][142] as well as Victoria Park,
London to the east. Primrose Hill to the north of Regent's Park is a
popular spot to view the city skyline.

Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including the
320-hectare (790-acre) Hampstead Heath of North London.[143] This
incorporates Kenwood House, the former stately home and a popular
location in the summer months where classical musical concerts are
held by the lake, attracting thousands of people every weekend to
enjoy the music, scenery and fireworks.[144]

With increasing industrialisation, London's population grew rapidly
throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it was for some time
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the most populous city in
the world until overtaken by New York City in 1925. Its population
peaked at 8,615,245 in 1939 immediately before the outbreak of the
Second World War, but had declined to 7,192,091 at the 2001
Census. However, the population then grew by just over a million
between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter
enumeration.

However, London's continuous urban area extends beyond the borders of
Greater London and was home to 9,787,426 people in 2011,[3] while its
wider metropolitan area has a population of between 12 and 14 million
depending on the definition used.[146][147] According to Eurostat,
London is the most populous city and metropolitan area of the European
Union and the second most populous in Europe (or third if Istanbul is
included). During the period 1991–2001 a net 726,000 immigrants
arrived in London.[148]

The region covers an area of 1,579 square kilometres (610 sq mi). The
population density is 5,177 inhabitants per square kilometre (13,410
/sq mi),[149] more than ten times that of any other British
region.[150] In terms of population, London is the 19th largest city
and the 18th largest metropolitan region in the world. As of 2014,
London has the largest number of billionaires (British Pound Sterling)
in the world, with 72 residing in the city.[151] London ranks as one
of the most expensive cities in the world, alongside Tokyo and
Moscow.[152]

Ethnic groups
Main article: Ethnic groups in London
According to the Office for National Statistics, based on the 2011
Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London
were White, with 44.9 per cent White British, 2.2 per cent White
Irish, 0.1 per cent gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1 per cent classified
as Other White.

20.9 per cent of Londoners are of Asian and mixed-Asian descent. 19.7
per cent are of full Asian descent, with those of mixed-Asian heritage
comprising 1.2 of the population. Indians account for 6.6 per cent of
the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7 per
cent each. Chinese peoples account for 1.5 per cent of the population,
with Arabs comprising 1.3 per cent. A further 4.9 per cent are
classified as "Other Asian".

15.6 per cent of London's population are of Black and mixed-Black
descent. 13.3 per cent are of full Black descent, with those of
mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3 per cent. Black Africans account
for 7.0 per cent of London's population, with 4.2 per cent as Black
Caribbean and 2.1 per cent as "Other Black". 5.0 per cent are of mixed
race.

Across London, Black and Asian children outnumber White British
children by about six to four in state schools.[153] However, White
children represented 62 per cent of London's 1,498,700 population aged
0 to 15, according to estimates from the Office for National
Statistics from 2009, with 55.7 per cent of the population aged 0 to
15 being White British, 0.7 per cent White Irish and 5.6 per cent from
other EU White backgrounds.[154] In January 2005, a survey of London's
ethnic and religious diversity claimed that there were more than 300
languages spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities
with a population of more than 10,000.[155] Figures from the Office
for National Statistics show that, in 2010, London's foreign-born
population was 2,650,000 (33 per cent), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.

The 2011 census showed that 36.7 per cent of Greater London's
population were born outside the UK.[156] The table to the right shows
the 20 most common foreign countries of birth of London residents in
2011, the date of the last published UK Census.[145] A portion of the
German-born population are likely to be British nationals born to
parents serving in the British Armed Forces in Germany.[157] Estimates
produced by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five
largest foreign-born groups living in London in the period July 2009
to June 2010 were those born in India, Poland, the Republic of
Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[158]

The largest ethnic-minority communities are:

Jamaican and Carribbean/West Indian in Brixton, Hackney (borough),
Tottenham, Harlesden, Peckham, Lewisham
West African in Southwark, Lewisham
Ghanaian in Mitcham
East African in Harlesden and Stonebridge
Indian in Southall, Hounslow, Brent (borough), Harrow (borough),
Ilford, Newham (borough)
Tamil (Indian and Sri Lankan) in South Harrow, Rayners Lane, Watford
(in Hertfordshire), East Ham, Wembley and Tooting
Pakistani and Bangladeshi in Newham (borough), Tower Hamlets
(borough), Waltham Forest (borough), and Barking & Dagenham (borough)
Arabs in Westminster
Poles in Ealing (borough), Haringey (borough), Brent (borough),
Waltham Forest (borough), Balham
Irish in Brent (borough), West Hampstead, Islington, Hanwell
French in South Kensington, Clapham, Camden, Ealing
Turks in Haringey (borough), Hackney (borough), Islington, Enfield
Italians in Freezywater, Waltham Cross and Cheshunt (both in
Hertfordshire).[159]

According to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings are
Christians (48.4 per cent), followed by those of no religion (20.7 per
cent), Muslims (12.4 per cent), no response (8.5 per cent), Hindus
(5.0 per cent), Jews (1.8 per cent), Sikhs (1.5 per cent), Buddhists
(1.0 per cent) and other (0.6 per cent).

London has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of
churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's
Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are
Anglican administrative centres,[161] while the Archbishop of
Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide
Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the
London Borough of Lambeth.[162]

Important national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's
and Westminster Abbey.[163] The Abbey is not to be confused with
nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic
cathedral in England and Wales.[164] Despite the prevalence of
Anglican churches, observance is very low within the Anglican
denomination. Church attendance continues on a long, slow, steady
decline, according to Church of England statistics.[165]



St Paul's Cathedral
London is also home to sizeable Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, and Jewish
communities. Many Muslims live in Tower Hamlets and Newham; the most
important Muslim edifice is London Central Mosque on the edge of
Regent's Park.[166] Following the oil boom, increasing numbers of
wealthy Middle-Eastern Muslims have based themselves around Mayfair
and Knightsbridge in west London.[167][168] London is home to the
largest mosque in western Europe, the Baitul Futuh Mosque, of the
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Since the spiritual head of the Community,
Mirza Masroor Ahmad resides in London, the city acts as the
international headquarters of the Community. London's large Hindu
community is in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the
latter of which is home to Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden
Temple.[169] London is also home to 42 Hindu temples. There are Sikh
communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to
one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple
outside India.[170]

The majority of British Jews live in London, with significant Jewish
communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley,
Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue
in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic
Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe which has held
regular services continuously for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons
Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any single Orthodox
synagogue in the whole of Europe, overtaking Ilford synagogue (also in
London) in 1998.[171] The community set up the London Jewish Forum in
2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London
Government.[172]

Economy
Main articles: Economy of London and Media in London


The City of London is one of the largest financial centres in the
world[14][16]
London generates approximately 20 per cent of the UK's GDP[173] (or
$446 billion in 2005); while the economy of the London metropolitan
area—the largest in Europe—generates approximately 30 per cent of the
UK's GDP (or an estimated $669 billion in 2005).[174] London is one of
the pre-eminent financial centres of the world and vies with New York
City as the most important location for international
finance.[175][176]

London's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make
it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000
people were employed in financial services in London until
mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city
in the world. Over 85% (3.2 million) of the employed population of
greater London works in the services industries. Because of its
prominent global role, London's economy has been affected by the
Late-2000s financial crisis. The City of London estimates that 70,000
jobs in finance will be cut within a year.[177] The City of London is
home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of
London insurance market.

Over half of the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over
100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in
central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's
metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have
offices in London.[178]



Canary Wharf is a major business and financial centre and is home to
some of the UK's tallest buildings
Along with professional services, media companies are concentrated in
London and the media distribution industry is London's second most
competitive sector.[179] The BBC is a significant employer, while
other broadcasters also have headquarters around the City. Many
national newspapers are edited in London. London is a major retail
centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city
in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion.[180] The
Port of London is the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling
45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[181]

London has five major business districts: the City, Westminster,
Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to
get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative
amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office
space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2
of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in
the world.[182][183]

A growing number of technology companies are based in London notably
in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. The city
will be among the first to receive a geoTLD, in spring or summer
2014.[184]

In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future
[185] in the 2014/15 list by FDi Magazine.[186]

London has the highest property prices of any European city according
to the Office of National Statistics and the European Office of
Statistics.[187] On average the price per square metre in central
London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property
prices in other G8 European capital cities; Berlin €3,306, Rome €6,188
and Paris €11,229.[188]

Tourism
Main article: Tourism in London


The Natural History Museum
London is a popular centre for tourism, one of its prime industries,
employing the equivalent of 350,000 full-time workers in 2003,[189]
while annual expenditure by tourists is around £15 billion.[190]
London attracts over 14 million international visitors per year,
making it Europe's most visited city.[191] London attracts 27 million
overnight-stay visitors every year.[192] In 2010 the ten most-visited
attractions in London were:[193]

British Museum
Tate Modern
National Gallery
Natural History Museum
London Eye
Science Museum
Victoria and Albert Museum
Madame Tussauds
National Maritime Museum
Tower of London
Transport
Main articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London


A black London taxi, also known as a hackney carriage.
Transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the
Mayor of London,[194] however the mayor's financial control does not
extend to the longer distance rail network that enters London. In 2007
he assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the
London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for
the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network
is administered by Transport for London (TfL) and is one of the most
extensive in the world. Cycling is an increasingly popular way to get
around London. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better
provision.[195]

The lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and
buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the
London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) or London Transport was
created. Transport for London (TfL), is now the statutory corporation
responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater
London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the
Mayor of London.[196]

Air


Heathrow (Terminal 5 pictured) is the busiest airport in the world for
international traffic.[197][198]
London is a major international air transport hub with the largest
city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word London in
their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. London
Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, is the busiest airport
in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the
nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[199] In March 2008 its fifth
terminal was opened.[200] There were plans for a third runway and a
sixth terminal however these were cancelled by the Coalition
Government on 12 May 2010.[201] In September 2011 a personal rapid
transit system was opened at Heathrow to connect to a nearby car
park.[202]

Similar traffic, with some cheap short-haul flights, is also handled
at Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex.[203]

Stansted Airport, north east of London in Essex, is a local UK hub and
Luton Airport to the north of London in Bedfordshire, caters mostly
for cheap short-haul flights.[204][205] London City Airport, the
smallest and most central airport, in Newham, East London, is focused
on business travellers, with a mixture of full service short-haul
scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[206]

London Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller,
regional airport that mainly caters for cheap short-haul flights. It
recently went through a large redevelopment project including a brand
new terminal, extended runway and a new railway station offering fast
links into the capital.

Buses and trams


The red double-decker bus is an iconic symbol of London
London's bus network is one of the largest in the world, running 24
hours a day, with approximately 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes
and around 19,500 bus stops.[207] In 2013, the network had more than 2
billion commuter trips per annum, more than the Underground.[207]
Around £850 million is taken in revenue each year. London has the
largest wheelchair accessible network in the world[208] and, from the
3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually
impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The
distinctive red double-decker buses are an internationally recognised
trademark of London transport along with black cabs and the
Tube.[209][210]

London has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink, based in Croydon
in South London. The network has 39 stops and four routes, and carried
28 million people in 2013.[211] Since June 2008 Transport for London
has completely owned Tramlink, and it plans to spend £54m by 2015 on
maintenance, renewals, upgrades and capacity enhancements. Since April
2009 all trams have been refurbished.[212]

Cable car
Main article: Emirates Air Line (cable car)
London's first and only cable car, known as the Emirate Air Line or
Thames cable car opened in June 2012. Crossing the River Thames,
linking Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks in the east of the
city, the cable car is integrated with London's Oyster Card ticketing
system.

Cycling
Main article: Cycling in London


Barclays Cycle Hire docking station in Southwark Street
Cycling in London has enjoyed a renaissance since the turn of the
Millennium. Cyclists enjoy a cheaper, and often quicker, way around
town than those using public transport or cars, and the launch of the
Barclays Cycle Hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and
generally well received.

Port and river boats
From being the largest port in the world, the Port of London is now
only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million
tonnes of cargo each year.[181] Most of this actually passes through
the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.

London also has frequent river boat services on the Thames known as
Thames Clippers. These run up to every 20 minutes between Embankment
Pier and North Greenwich Pier. The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million
passengers every year,[213] is a frequent service linking the North
and South Circular Roads. Other operators also run both commuter and
tourist boat services in London.

Rail
Underground and DLR


The London Underground is the world's oldest and second-longest rapid
transit system
The London Underground — all of which is now commonly referred to as
the Tube, though originally this designation referred only to the
deep-level lines, as distinct from the sub-surface lines — is the
oldest,[214] and second longest[36] metro system in the world, dating
from 1863. The system serves 270 stations[215] and was formed from
several private companies, including the world's first underground
electric line, the City and South London Railway.[216]

Over three million journeys are made every day on the Underground
network, over 1 billion each year.[217] An investment programme is
attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including
£6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer
Olympics.[218] London has been commended as the city with the best
public transport.[219] The Docklands Light Railway, which opened in
1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter
tram-type vehicles which serve Docklands and Greenwich.

Suburban
There are 366 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an
extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London,
particularly has a high concentration of railways as it fewer
Underground lines. London houses Britain's busiest station – Waterloo,
with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex
(which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[220][221] While
Clapham Junction is the busiest station in Europe by the number of
trains passing. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London,
running into eighteen terminal stations with the exception of the
Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the
south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[222]

With the need for more rail capacity in London, Crossrail is due to
open in 2018. It will be a new railway line running east to west
through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow
Airport.[223] It is Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15
billion projected cost.[224][225]

InterCity and International


St Pancras railway station is the main terminal for high speed
Eurostar and HS1 services, as well as suburban Thameslink and East
Midlands Trains services.
London is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70% of rail
journeys starting or ending in London.[226] Like suburban rail
services, Regional and InterCity trains depart from several termini
around the City Centre, linking London with the rest of Britain
including: Cambridge, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds,
Manchester, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Since 2007 high-speed Eurostar trains link St. Pancras International
with Lille, Paris, and Brussels. Journey times to Paris and Brussels
of two-and-a-quarter hours and one hour 50 minutes respectively make
London closer to continental Europe than the rest of Britain by virtue
of the High Speed 1 rail link to the Channel Tunnel[227] while the
first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to
London.[228] There are plans for a second high speed line between
London and the West Midlands.

The A102, near Greenwich. This was one of the few routes proposed in
the Ringways Plan within Inner London to be built.
Although the majority of journeys involving central London are made by
public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring
road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (in
the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, outside the
built-up area) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of
busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner
London. The M25 is the longest ring-road motorway in the world at
121.5 mi (195.5 km) long.[229][230] The A1 and M1 connect London to
Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.

A plan for a comprehensive network of motorways throughout the city
(the Ringways Plan) was prepared in the 1960s but was mostly cancelled
in the early 1970s. In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to
reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions,
motorists are required to pay £10 per day to drive within a defined
zone encompassing much of central London.[231][232] Motorists who are
residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass
which is renewed monthly and is cheaper than a corresponding bus
fare.[233] London is notorious for its traffic congestion, with the
M25 motorway the busiest stretch in the country. The average speed of
a car in the rush hour is 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[234] London government
initially expected the Congestion Charge Zone to increase daily peak
period Underground and bus users by 20,000 people, reduce road traffic
by 10 to 15 per cent, increase traffic speeds by 10 to 15 per cent,
and reduce queues by 20 to 30 per cent.[235] Over the course of
several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of
London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars – a
35-per-cent reduction of vehicles driven per day.[236]

Culture
Main article: Culture of London
Accent
The London accent long ago acquired the Cockney label, which is heard
both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region
more generally.[246] The accent of a 21st-century 'Londoner' varies
widely; what is becoming more and more common amongst the under-30s
however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of 'ethnic'
accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled
Multicultural London English (MLE).[247]

Keats House, where Keats wrote his Ode to a Nightingale. The village
of Hampstead has historically been a literary centre in London.
London has been the setting for many works of literature. The literary
centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since
the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with
the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness
account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a
foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been
a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and
Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary
figures of the 20th century.[255]

living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also
based there, and some of his work—most notably his play The
Alchemist—was set in the city.[255] A Journal of the Plague Year
(1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665
Great Plague.[255] Later important depictions of London from the 19th
and early 20th centuries are Dickens' novels, and Arthur Conan Doyle's
Sherlock Holmes stories.[255] Modern writers pervasively influenced by
the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a "biography" of London, and
Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography.

Museums and art galleries


The British Museum
London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions,
many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist
attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to
be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in
1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and
the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from
around the globe. In 1824 the National Gallery was founded to house
the British national collection of Western paintings; this now
occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square. In the latter half
of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as
"Albertopolis", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major
national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the
applied arts), the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. The
National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of
figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's
most extensive collection of portraits.[257] The national gallery of
British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of
the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly
known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this
collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former
Bankside Power Station.
